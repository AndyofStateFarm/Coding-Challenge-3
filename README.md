# Car Class Implementation Challenge

1. Implement a Car class with a constructor that initializes the make (brand of the car) and speed (current speed in km/h) properties.
2. Implement an accelerate method in the Car class that increases the car's speed by 10 km/h and logs the new speed to the console.
3. Implement a brake method that decreases the car's speed by 5 km/h and logs the new speed to the console.
4. -Create two Car objects using the provided test data. <br/>
   -Test the accelerate and brake methods on each object, calling each method multiple times to demonstrate functionality.
